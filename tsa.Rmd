# Motivation

Increasing evidence has shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases are a primary driver of climate change (IPCC, 2013). This
makes worldwide emissions one of the worldâ€™s most pressing challenges and has
provoked various international agreement, like the Paris Agreement on emission
reduction and other climate goals. Three of the largest current emitting regions
are China, the US and the EU.

# Introduction

The main topic of this term paper is to analyze and model the trends of CO2 emissions in some of the countries of the European Union, the United States of America and China (and perhaps comparing them with emerging economics such as Brazil and India). Current actions to mitigate the climate effects of such steep rise of CO2 emissions over the last 50-60 years (citation needed) are not enough to reach the goals set in the Paris Agreement by 2030. Such is the slowed response from the governing institutions and international organizations that the current trends indicate that the temperature increases (and all the consequences behind it) will be irreversible in less that 5 years(citation needed).
This paper is organized as follows: Initially, we will analyze the trends of CO2 emissions of the above-mentioned countries, secondly we  will design a fitting econometric model. Lastly, a forecast for the next periods based on the model will be presented.


 The econometric and economic theory is briefly described and related literature is presented

Idea: compare with GDP or GNP

Include kyoto and paris agreement and other historical events (fukushima, fridays for future?)

# The model and data

The econometric model and the data applied are described, a first descriptive analysis of the data is shown

# Estimation and results

The model choice is reasoned well in statistical and economic terms, the estimation results are presented, the results are interpreted and connected to the economic theory and literature from point 1.

Find an appropriate ARIMA model to describe the three series. Base your
decision on (P)ACFs, unit root tests, AIC and further diagnostic checks.
What limits the validity of these results?
4. Forecast the CO2 emissions one period ahead and for 2030 based on the chosen model. Evaluate the forecast in comparison to an alternative prediction
method.
5. Discuss the economic consequences of your results and suggest different
techniques how your model and a potential long-term forecast could be
improved.

# Conclusion:

Summary of the main results and outlook on further interesting research directions
